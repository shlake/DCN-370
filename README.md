# DCN-370
working space to capture changes to curation

I assume I download the zip file and unzip it?

No documentation of what to do with the files, maybe it is the readme?

## Missing ##
how to run docker, if not familiar with it (At least Sherry wasn't)

When trying following manual install of **Download CPA-Checker** - "ant" program wasn't installed on my Mac - and there was no mention that this is needed or where to get it. The CPA-Checker github has further instructions for intalling this that are not in this README.md file: https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpachecker/blob/trunk/INSTALL.md OR add "ant" to this line in the README.md (to install it)?
`sudo apt-get install python3 wget openjdk-11-jre`



## Manual Install ##
installing ShadowDP worked per instructions
